### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aleksandra!

Aspiring Software Engineer, based in London, UK.

After 2.5 years in the Admin and Higher Education sector, I have decided to switch into Tech. I have discovered my passion for coding and playing around with different programming languages,
hoping to learn and develop new skills along the way.

ðŸ”­ I am currently doing a 16-week Software Engineering Bootcamp with Hyperion Dev. 

ðŸŒ± I am learning and exploring the potential of Python in VS Code.

âœ¨ I have done a few other online courses focusing on Web Devlopment with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.

ðŸ‘¯ I would love to find an employment opportunity that helps me grow and develop in the industry, as well as lets me showcase my newly gained skills and knowledge!
